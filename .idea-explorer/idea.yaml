  title: Story CoT
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: 'Training language models to use chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in
    the form of stories, similar to how humans recount memories or ideas about situations,
    may improve performance on certain tasks compared to current CoT approaches. This
    research will investigate whether models trained to produce story-like CoTs perform
    better on tasks such as physics problem modeling, and whether such CoTs leverage
    different patterns than those used by current large language models.

    '
  background:
    description: Current chain-of-thought (CoT) methods in language models simulate
      a fuzzy reasoning process, but it is unclear if this reflects how humans actually
      think. Humans often reason in stories, recounting memories or projecting ideas
      about situations in narrative form. This idea proposes training models from
      base to post-training to use CoTs as stories, as people do, and asks whether
      this approach would improve performance on tasks like physics problem modeling,
      whether it is more effective for some tasks, and if models are capable of producing
      such story-like CoTs or if current CoT methods exploit hidden patterns in large
      language models.
